The parent repository is available as a free template at https://github.com/byu-transpolab/template_bookdown. The advice in this document comes from numerous sources. Some of it is my own, some has been shared by others. Particular note belongs to: Laurie Garrow Lisa Rosenstein Kara Kockelman The introduction of your report is not simply an “introduction,” but rather a motivation of why your project matters. What is the cost of not solving this problem? What have been previous attempts to solve this problem? The why is more important than the what. Why is this article worthy of archiving? A three or four-paragraph structure can work well here. Identify the problem and why it matters. A high-level overview of some previous attempts to solve it, and why those attempts were limited (this might be two paragraphs). Describe the approach (very briefly), and provide an overview of what is to come. “In this paper we present …” "],["literature.html", " 2 Literature", " 2 Literature Here is a review of existing methods. Use the bookdown (Xie, 2015) package referencing system to make it easy on yourself. The literature review is not simply a “review” or a list of what has been done in the past. This needs to a thoughtful synthesis that accomplishes two things: Shows that you understand the previous efforts that other people have made on this problem. Identifies the limitation or the gap in those previous efforts. You will have already mentioned this gap in the introduction, but here you need to build a solid case for why what you are doing is a meaningful contribution. Literature reviews do not have a specific guidelines for length or number of citations. It’s more about making a rhetorical argument; if it’s a new problem then the review can be shorter. But you’ll need to refer to previous attempts at the problem, the methods you are trying, and other things. References "],["methods.html", " 3 Methods 3.1 Data 3.2 Models", " 3 Methods In this chapter, you describe the approach you have taken on the problem. This usually involves a discussion about both the data you used and the models you applied. 3.1 Data Discuss where you got your data, how you cleaned it, any assumptions you made. data(&quot;Car&quot;, package = &quot;mlogit&quot;) car_mlogit &lt;- Car %&gt;% mutate(choice = gsub(&quot;choice&quot;, &quot;&quot;, choice)) %&gt;% dfidx( varying = 5:70, shape = &quot;wide&quot;, choice = &quot;choice&quot;, sep = &quot;&quot;) Often there will be a table describing summary statistics of your dataset.

But this is where you describe the mathematical construction of your model, the variables it uses, and other things. Some methods are so common (linear regression) that it is unnecessary to explore them in detail. But others will need to be described, often with mathematics. For example, the probability of a multinomial logit model is \\[\\begin{equation} P_i(X_{in}) = \\frac{e^{X_{in}\\beta_i}}{\\sum_{j \\in J}e^{X_{jn}\\beta_j}} \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] Use LaTeX mathematics. You’ll want to number display equations so that you can refer to them later in the manuscript. Other simpler math can be described inline, like saying that \\(i, j \\in J\\). Details on using equations in bookdown are available here. "],["applications.html", " 4 Applications 4.1 Additional Analysis", " 4 Applications This section might be called “Results” instead of “Applications,” depending on what it is that you are working on. But you’ll probably say something like “The initial model estimation results are given in Table 4.1.” That table is created with the modelsummary() package and function. model1 &lt;- mlogit(choice ~ type + price | -1, data = car_mlogit) model2 &lt;- update(model1, .~. + range) models &lt;- list(&quot;Model 1&quot; = model1, &quot;Model 2&quot; = model2) modelsummary(models, estimate = &quot;{estimate} ({statistic})&quot;, title = &quot;Model Estimation Results&quot;) Table 4.1: Model Estimation Results Model 1 Model 2 typesportuv 0.833 (5.945) 0.815 (5.805) (0.140) (0.140) typesportcar 0.614 (4.192) 0.628 (4.259) (0.146) (0.147) typestwagon −1.415 (−22.979) −1.428 (−23.119) (0.062) (0.062) typetruck −1.002 (−20.600) −1.010 (−20.673) (0.049) (0.049) typevan −0.812 (−17.431) −0.806 (−17.183) (0.047) (0.047) price −0.221 (−8.475) −0.191 (−7.130) (0.026) (0.027) range 0.003 (18.923) (0.000) Num.Obs. 4654 4654 AIC 15460.9 15075.0 BIC Log.Lik. −7724.469 −7530.510 rho2 −0.052 −0.026 rho20 0.074 0.097 With those results presented, you can go into a discussion of what they mean. first, discuss the actual results that are shown in the table, and then any interesting or unintuitive observations. 4.1 Additional Analysis Usually, it is good to use your model for something. Hypothetical policy analysis Statistical validation effort Equity or impact analysis If the analysis is substantial, it might become its own top-level section. "],["conclusions.html", " 5 Conclusions", " 5 Conclusions This section need not be overly long. You should address any limitations of your results, such as dependence on underlying assumptions or geographic scope. You should also provide a map for future research. Finally, you should underline the contributions of this work and any practical relevance.
