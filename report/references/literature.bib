   abstract = {The MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation) software project was started around 2006 with the goal of generating traffic and congestion patterns by following individual synthetic travelers through their daily or weekly activity programme. It has since then evolved from a collection of stand-alone C++ programs to an integrated Java-based framework which is publicly hosted, open-source available, automatically regression tested. It is currently used by about 40 groups throughout the world. This book takes stock of the current status. The first part of the book gives an introduction to the most important concepts, with the intention of enabling a potential user to set up and run basic simulations.The second part of the book describes how the basic functionality can be extended, for example by adding schedule-based public transit, electric or autonomous cars, paratransit, or within-day replanning. For each extension, the text provides pointers to the additional documentation and to the code base. It is also discussed how people with appropriate Java programming skills can write their own extensions, and plug them into the MATSim core. The project has started from the basic idea that traffic is a consequence of human behavior, and thus humans and their behavior should be the starting point of all modelling, and with the intuition that when simulations with 100 million particles are possible in computational physics, then behavior-oriented simulations with 10 million travelers should be possible in travel behavior research. The initial implementations thus combined concepts from computational physics and complex adaptive systems with concepts from travel behavior research. The third part of the book looks at theoretical concepts that are able to describe important aspects of the simulation system; for example, under certain conditions the code becomes a Monte Carlo engine sampling from a discrete choice model. Another important aspect is the interpretation of the MATSim score as utility in the microeconomic sense, opening up a connection to benefit cost analysis. Finally, the book collects use cases as they have been undertaken with MATSim. All current users of MATSim were invited to submit their work, and many followed with sometimes crisp and short and sometimes longer contributions, always with pointers to additional references. We hope that the book will become an invitation to explore, to build and to extend agent-based modeling of travel behavior from the stable and well tested core of MATSim documented here.},

   abstract = {Agent-based models have gained wide acceptance in transportation planning because with increasing computational power, large-scale people-centric mobility simulations are possible. Several modeling efforts have been reported in the literature on the demand side (with sophisticated activity-based models that focus on an individual's day activity patterns) and on the supply side (with detailed representation of network dynamics through simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment models). This paper proposes an extension to a state-of-the-art integrated agent-based demand and supply model-SimMobility-for the design and evaluation of autonomous vehicle systems. SimMobility integrates various mobility-sensitive behavioral models in a multiple timescale structure comprising three simulation levels: (a) a long-term level that captures land use and economic activity, with special emphasis on accessibility; (b) a midterm level that handles agents' activities and travel patterns; and (c) a short-term level that simulates movement of agents, operational systems, and decisions at a microscopic granularity. In that context, this paper proposes several extensions at the short-term and midterm levels to model and simulate autonomous vehicle systems and their effects on travel behavior. To showcase these features, the first-cut results of a hypothetical on-demand service with autonomous vehicles in a car-restricted zone of Singapore are presented. SimMobility was successfully used in an integrated manner to test and assess the performance of different autonomous vehicle fleet sizes and parking station configurations and to uncover changes in individual mobility patterns, specifically in regard to modal shares, routes, and destinations. Although the initial developments of autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies were carried out during the 1980s (1), vehicle automation technology has been under the spotlight since the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge (2). It is considered a key research effort in many car manufacturer and mobility and robotics research centers (3) and has recently begun to be marketed for personal use (4-6). AVs rely on extensive technological developments in software and hardware integration, high-level control design, sensor technology and data fusion techniques, motion control algorithms, and vehicle communication tasks (7). All of these components continue to evolve and to be rethought for particular deployments, such as new fault-tolerance sensing frameworks (8), first-and last-mile targeted systems (9), or innovative communications for vehicular networks design (10). These developments target change in the efficiency, safety, and cost of vehicular systems. Yet, aspirations for vehicle automation technology's contributions in solving large-scale transportation problems-such as pollution, road congestion, and land use-are also high but are still to be clarified, as they may rely on the design of the integrated service itself and the environment in which it will be deployed (3). Recent studies have focused on the design and operation of specific AV systems beyond private use, such as on-demand services [autonomous mobility on demand (AMOD)] (11-15). Zachariah et al. modeled the implementation of a fleet of autonomous taxis in New Jersey based on origin-destination trips derived from travel surveys and focusing on vehicle occupancy rates (14). The studies of Pavone et al. (11) and Smith et al. (12) showed a theoretical solution to fleet sizing by introducing rebalancing assignments that minimize the number of empty vehicles traveling in the network. The introduced rebalancing policy (based on a fluidic model) has been tested in a low-fidelity simulation developed in MATLAB, and-using theoretical and simulation results-it is possible to determine the minimum number of vehicles required to maintain the systems' stability. In the case of AMOD systems, fleet sizing is similar to the fleet sizing of mobility on-demand systems with human-driven vehicles, but with the advantage that the vehicles can redistribute themselves. Barrios and Doig Godier, for example, evaluated three rebalancing strategies (zero, periodic, and continuous redistribution) for mobility on-demand systems (16). This evaluation was performed for a station-based (i.e., vehicles can be picked up and dropped off only at predefined stations) and a free-floating (i.e., a vehicle can be picked up and dropped off anywhere within an operating zone) system. Analysis was performed with an agent-based simulation approach and tested on a square grid with a random demand. Similarly , Brownell and Kornhauser evaluated the necessary AV fleet size for two scenarios: (a) personal rapid transit and (b) smart para-transit (13). While the models did not account for rebalancing, they do give insight into the upper and lower bounds of the fleet size required for both models. The mobility effects of these systems have begun to be analyzed only recently. In the Urban Mobility System Upgrade study, the},

Dynamic ridesharing is a newer way to share rides on the fly or up to several days in advance using cell phone or computer messaging to make arrangements. This paper describes research conducted to assess the potential for dynamic ridesharing for travel to downtown Berkeley, California, and the University of California, Berkeley, campus. The study provides insights about the opportunities and challenges presented by this travel option. Data were collected from statistical and geographic analysis of the downtown and campus travel markets, and surveys and focus groups were administered to employees and graduate students. The study found that about one-fifth of commuters who drive alone to the campus would be interested in using dynamic ridesharing at least occasionally and live in areas where matches could be found. They would prefer to arrange a shared ride at least the night before rather than immediately before the trip is made. Many of these travelers were unaware of current rideshare services, and some would be willing to find a regular carpool partner. Finally, if parking charges are fairly high and parking supply is limited and regulated, financial incentives and carpool parking subsidies greatly increase interest in dynamic ridesharing.},

The combination of an on-demand and line-based service holds the promise of improved mobility and increased service coverage. However, to date, it remains unknown whether DRT services deliver these much anticipated improvements. This study presents an assessment framework to evaluate the performance of DRT and related changes in accessibility, and performs an empirical analysis for a recently introduced DRT service in the Netherlands. The framework includes a performance benchmark between DRT and FT based on the computation of generalized journey times of the DRT rides and the FT alternatives, and can help identify whether DRT is used as a complement or a substitute for FT. The framework covers the spatial and temporal dimensions, and the explicit consideration of rejected trips is an integral part of the evaluation. Results suggest large accessibility improvements for DRT users, especially for some underserved origin–destination pairs.},

   abstract = {Recent advancements in automated vehicle technology and the concurrent emergence of ride-hailing services have focused increasing attention on Automated Mobility-on-Demand (AMOD; a system of shared driverless taxis) as a potential solution for sustainable future urban mobility. However, the impacts of an unrestricted deployment of AMOD are as yet uncertain and likely to be context-specific; evidence with existing on-demand services suggests that they may lead to the cannibalization of mass-transit and increased traffic congestion. In this context, automated demand-responsive transit (also termed microtransit), which provides similar on-demand services (stop-to-stop or curbside) through higher capacity vehicles, may prove to be a promising substitute and/or complement. In this study, we evaluate the performance of such an automated demand response transit system (hereafter AMOD minibus) through agent-based simulations of the Singapore network. Towards this end, we extend SimMobility (an agent- and activity-based microsimulation laboratory) with the capability of modeling an AMOD minibus service including demand, supply and their interactions. On the demand side, we use an activity-based model system that draws on data from a stated-preferences survey conducted in Singapore. On the supply side, an insertion heuristic is applied to dynamically perform both the assignment of requests to vehicles and vehicle routing. Scenario simulations on the Singapore network (with an area-wide deployment of the AMOD services) indicate the potential benefits of an automated demand responsive transit service for local circulation, which can result in a reduction of Vehicle Kilometres Traveled of up to 50% (compared to the AMOD shared taxis) whilst satisfying the same demand, with a modest increase in average travel times.},

Two architectures of the GCNN-DDGF model are explored; GCNNreg-DDGF is a regular GCNN-DDGF model which contains the convolution and feedforward blocks, and GCNNrec-DDGF additionally contains a recurrent block from the Long Short-term Memory neural network architecture to capture temporal dependencies in the bike-sharing demand series. Furthermore, four types of GCNN models are proposed whose adjacency matrices are based on various bike-sharing system data, including Spatial Distance matrix (SD), Demand matrix (DE), Average Trip Duration matrix (ATD), and Demand Correlation matrix (DC). These six types of GCNN models and seven other benchmark models are built and compared on a Citi Bike dataset from New York City which includes 272 stations and over 28 million transactions from 2013 to 2016. Results show that the GCNNrec-DDGF performs the best in terms of the Root Mean Square Error, the Mean Absolute Error and the coefficient of determination (R2), followed by the GCNNreg-DDGF. They outperform the other models. Through a more detailed graph network analysis based on the learned DDGF, insights are obtained on the “black box” of the GCNN-DDGF model. It is found to capture some information similar to details embedded in the SD, DE and DC matrices. More importantly, it also uncovers hidden heterogeneous pairwise correlations between stations that are not revealed by any of those matrices.},

The paper presents a bilevel optimization where the leader problem designs the network and each rider has a follower problem to decide her best route through the ODMTS. The bilevel model is solved by a decomposition algorithm that combines traditional Benders cuts with combinatorial cuts to ensure the consistency of mode choices by the leader and follower problems.

   abstract = {Short-term passenger demand forecasting is of great importance to the on-demand ride service platform, which can incentivize vacant cars moving from over-supply regions to over-demand regions. The spatial dependencies, temporal dependencies, and exogenous dependencies need to be considered simultaneously, however, which makes short-term passenger demand forecasting challenging. We propose a novel deep learning (DL) approach, named the fusion convolutional long short-term memory network (FCL-Net), to address these three dependencies within one end-to-end learning architecture. The model is stacked and fused by multiple convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, standard LSTM layers, and convolutional layers. The fusion of convolutional techniques and the LSTM network enables the proposed DL approach to better capture the spatio-temporal characteristics and correlations of explanatory variables. A tailored spatially aggregated random forest is employed to rank the importance of the explanatory variables. The ranking is then used for feature selection. The proposed DL approach is applied to the short-term forecasting of passenger demand under an on-demand ride service platform in Hangzhou, China. The experimental results, validated on the real-world data provided by DiDi Chuxing, show that the FCL-Net achieves the better predictive performance than traditional approaches including both classical time-series prediction models and state-of-art machine learning algorithms (e.g., artificial neural network, XGBoost, LSTM and CNN). Furthermore, the consideration of exogenous variables in addition to the passenger demand itself, such as the travel time rate, time-of-day, day-of-week, and weather conditions, is proven to be promising, since they reduce the root mean squared error (RMSE) by 48.3%. It is also interesting to find that the feature selection reduces 24.4% in the training time and leads to only the 1.8% loss in the forecasting accuracy measured by RMSE in the proposed model. This paper is one of the first DL studies to forecast the short-term passenger demand of an on-demand ride service platform by examining the spatio-temporal correlations.},

This study uses a 2018 survey of 1,684 employed respondents from vehicle-holding households residing in Southern Ontario, Canada. Stated preference choice experiments are administered and mixed logit models are estimated to explore consumer interest in adopting driverless on-demand vehicles, shared on-demand vehicles, transit plus on-demand vehicles, and driverless public transit shuttles. Monetized generalized costs of each of these choice attributes are estimated. Results indicate generalized costs from combining transit with on-demand ride hailing (a frequently contemplated “last-mile” solution), while users are relatively ambivalent about the generalized cost of shared on-demand ride-hailing. Results indicate that consumers view driverless public transit shuttles and driverless cars as conferring higher generalized costs than vehicles with drivers. Overall, results suggest that the market shares of these modes depend on the potential for service providers to capitalize on heterogenous preferences among consumers. As such, insofar that public transit agencies and the public sector appear less well-suited to nimbly meet heterogeneous consumer demand, the private sector appears poised to play the most direct role in leveraging these new technologies towards meeting user needs. In turn, these findings suggest that the best role for the public sector with respect these new services lies in establishing incentives by engaging with private industry and/or regulating downstream impacts of new mobility services.},

Mode share of these DRT services, against car or bus travel, was simulated from mixed logit models within a panel data modelling framework estimated from survey data. The survey was conducted of over 400 respondents in urban (Rochdale, Manchester) and rural (Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire) areas. Experience shows that it is particularly difficult to make DRT services financially viable. Of the DRT services investigated, those targeting airline or train passengers offer potential. However, they are in direct competition with the car, and so their success depends on the cost and availability of parking spaces. Some of the DRT schemes explored meet social needs, such as to access shopping facilities or hospitals, but they face cost challenges. In addition, institutional barriers for new DRT schemes need to be overcome in order to develop a sustainable local public transport system.},

   abstract = {In this paper we study the impact on productivity of specific operating practices currently used by demand responsive transit (DRT) providers. We investigate the effect of using a zoning vs. a no-zoning strategy and time-window settings on performance measures such as total trip miles, deadhead miles and fleet size. It is difficult to establish closed-form expressions to assess the impact on the performance measures of a specific zoning practice or time-window setting for a real transportation network. Thus, we conduct this study through a simulation model of the operations of DRT providers on a network based on data for DRT service in Los Angeles County. However, the methodology is quite general and applicable to any other service area. Our results suggest the existence of linear relationships between operating practices and performance measures. In particular we observe that for each minute increase in time-window size the service saves approximately 2 vehicles and 260 miles driven and that a no-zoning strategy is able to satisfy the same demand by employing 60 less vehicles and driving 10,000 less total miles with respect to the current zoning strategy. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Conventional bus service (with fixed routes and schedules) has lower average cost than flexible bus service (with demand-responsive routes) at high demand densities. At low demand densities flexible bus service has lower average costs and provides convenient door-to-door service. Bus size and operation type are related since larger buses have lower average cost per passenger at higher demand densities. The operation type and other decisions are jointly optimized here for a bus transit system connecting a major terminal to local regions. Conventional and flexible bus sizes, conventional bus route spacings, areas of service zones for flexible buses, headways, and fleet sizes are jointly optimized in multi-dimensional nonlinear mixed integer optimization problems. To solve them, we propose a hybrid approach, which combines analytic optimization with a Genetic Algorithm. Numerical analysis confirms that the proposed method provides near-optimal solutions and shows how the proposed Mixed Fleet Variable Type Bus Operation (MFV) can reduce total cost compared to alternative operations such as Single Fleet Conventional Bus (SFC), Single Fleet Flexible Bus (SFF), Mixed Fleet Conventional Bus (MFC) and Mixed Fleet Flexible Bus (MFF). With consistent system-wide bus sizes, capital costs are reduced by sharing fleets over times and over regions. The sensitivity of results to several important parameters is also explored. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Ride-sharing services are transforming urban mobility by providing timely and convenient transportation to anybody, anywhere, and anytime. These services present enormous potential for positive societal impacts with respect to pollution, energy consumption, congestion, etc. Current mathematical models, however, do not fully address the potential of ride-sharing. Recently, a largescale study highlighted some of the benefits of car pooling but was limited to static routes with two riders per vehicle (optimally) or three (with heuristics).We present a more general mathematical model for real-time high-capacity ride-sharing that (i) scales to large numbers of passengers and trips and (ii) dynamically generates optimal routes with respect to online demand and vehicle locations. The algorithm starts from a greedy assignment and improves it through a constrained optimization, quickly returning solutions of good quality and converging to the optimal assignment over time. We quantify experimentally the tradeoff between fleet size, capacity, waiting time, travel delay, and operational costs for low- to medium-capacity vehicles, such as taxis and van shuttles. The algorithm is validated with ~3 million rides extracted from the New York City taxicab public dataset. Our experimental study considers ride-sharing with rider capacity of up to 10 simultaneous passengers per vehicle. The algorithm applies to fleets of autonomous vehicles and also incorporates rebalancing of idling vehicles to areas of high demand. This framework is general and can be used for many real-time multivehicle, multitask assignment problems.},

The granularity of the GPS data necessary for this analysis is relatively coarse; it only requires coordinates for the beginning and end of trips, the metered distance, and the total travel time. The method works by computing the historical distribution of pace (normalized travel times) between various regions of a city and measuring the pace deviations during an unusual event. This method is applied to a dataset of nearly 700 million taxi trips in New York City, which is used to analyze the transportation infrastructure resilience to Hurricane Sandy. The analysis indicates that Hurricane Sandy impacted traffic conditions for more than five days, and caused a peak delay of two minutes per mile. Practically, it identifies that the evacuation caused only minor disruptions, but significant delays were encountered during the post-disaster reentry process. Since the implementation of this method is very efficient, it could potentially be used as an online monitoring tool, representing a first step toward quantifying city scale resilience with coarse GPS data.},

   abstract = {Logit models are usually applied when studying individual travel behavior, i.e., to predict travel mode choice and to gain behavioral insights on traveler preferences. Recently, some studies have applied machine learning to model travel mode choice and reported higher out-of-sample predictive accuracy than traditional logit models (e.g., multinomial logit). However, little research focuses on comparing the interpretability of machine learning with logit models. In other words, how to draw behavioral insights from the high-performance "black-box" machine-learning models remains largely unsolved in the field of travel behavior modeling. This paper aims at providing a comprehensive comparison between the two approaches by examining the key similarities and differences in model development, evaluation, and behavioral interpretation between logit and machine-learning models for travel mode choice modeling. To complement the theoretical discussions, the paper also empirically evaluates the two approaches on the stated-preference survey data for a new type of transit system integrating high-frequency fixed-route services and ridesourcing. The results show that machine learning can produce significantly higher predictive accuracy than logit models. Moreover, machine learning and logit models largely agree on many aspects of behavioral interpretations. In addition, machine learning can automatically capture the nonlinear relationship between the input features and choice outcomes. The paper concludes that there is great potential in merging ideas from machine learning and conventional statistical methods to develop refined models for travel behavior research and suggests some new research directions.},

   abstract = {Automated Mobility on Demand (AMoD) is a concept that has recently generated much discussion. In cases where large-scale adoption of an automated taxi service is anticipated, the service's impacts may become relevant to key transport system metrics, and thus to transport planners and policy-makers as well. In light of this increasingly important question, this paper presents an agent-based transport simulation with (single passenger) AMoD. In contrast to earlier studies, all scenario data (including demand patterns, cost assumptions and customer behaviour) is obtained for one specific area, the city of Zurich, Switzerland. The simulation study fuses information from a detailed bottom-up cost analysis of mobility services in Switzerland, a specifically tailored Stated-Preferences survey about automated mobility services conducted in the canton of Zurich, and a detailed agent-based transport simulation for the city, based on MATSim. Methodologically, a comprehensive approach is presented that iteratively runs these components to derive states in which service cost, waiting times and demand are in equilibrium for a cost-covering AMoD operator with predefined fleet size. For Zurich, several cases are examined, with 4,000 AMoD vehicles leading to the maximum demand of around 150,000 requests per day that can be attracted by the system. Within these parameters, the simulation results show that customers are willing to accept average waiting times of around 4 min at a price of 0.75 CHF/km. Further cost-covering cases with lower demand are presented, where either smaller fleet sizes lead to higher waiting times, or larger fleet sizes lead to higher costs. While our simulations indicate that an AMoD system in Zurich can bring benefits to the users, they show that the system impact is largely negative. Caused by modal shifts, our simulations show an increase of driven distance of up to 100%. All examined fleet configurations of the unregulated, cost-covering, single-passenger, door-to-door AMoD service are found to be highly counter-productive on a path towards a more shared and active transport system. Accordingly, policy recommendations for regulation are discussed.},

   abstract = {Technologic advancements have contributed to the spread of sharing economy concepts, a developing phenomenon that favors the shift from private mobility to service-use (shared mobility). One-way carsharing is a most recent and popular kind of shared mobility, that is growing and developing rapidly in various forms. These systems are considered to have a transformative impact on future urban transportation. Despite all of the benefits that have been reported from the use of new one-way carsharing (e.g. Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand systems), their impacts on the mobility are not certain yet. This comes from the fact that in such services supply and demand influence each other in a significant way in short-, mid-, and long-term. Also service characteristics at the level of each vehicle strongly affect the demand. In this paper methods, paradigms, toolkits and platforms used in the literature for the demand estimation of the new one-way carsharing systems, as well as their potential drawbacks are discussed. A review of the literature reveals that despite the considerable number of studies related to balancing vehicle stocks across stations in one-way systems, the investigation about demand estimation of such services for which the complex relationship between supply and demand is considered, remain very limited. The majority of current platforms and toolkits used for demand estimation of new one-way carsharing systems are based on activity-based multi-agent simulations. In these simulations several main components are not yet taken into account, which could dramatically change the results. Data detail, accessibility and reliability, high computational time, calibration and validation still remain major challenges for travel demand estimation for one-way carsharing systems.},

   abstract = {Public transport in urban and suburban areas is not always able to meet population’s need of accessibility to jobs, education, health and other opportunities in terms of routes and frequencies; therefore, those who do not own a private vehicle, or who cannot afford public individual transport (e.g. taxis), often find themselves in a condition of social exclusion and disadvantage. Taking advantages from new ICT tools and facilities, Demand Responsive Shared Transport (DRST) services can provide “on demand” transport services gathering ride bookings of different users and routing a fleet of vehicles to satisfy passengers’ need while minimizing the cost for the operator. In this paper, different DRST service configurations are compared to taxi services to investigate their convenience and sustainability. This is done by using an agent-based simulation model applied to the case of Ragusa (Italy), a city with poor public transport offer where an innovative DRST service has already been experimented. A set of 50 different scenarios has been simulated, by varying the numbers of vehicles and seat capacity, and considering different demand rates and route choice strategies of the vehicles. Results are analyzed according to different key performance indicators, mainly showing that the DRST system is more advantageous than taxis when dealing with higher demand rates. On the other hand, the efficiency of the DRST system is rather limited compared to taxis in the case of low transport demand and fleets with a small number of vehicles. Between high and low demand there is a balance between the taxi and the DRST systems, where one should deepen the analysis to identify the optimal operational parameters. These results pave the way for further analyses to help the planning and design of intermediate transport services like DRST, which are able to bridge the gap between collective and individual transport in urban and suburban areas.},

   abstract = {Carsharing programs that operate as short-term vehicle rentals (often for one-way trips before ending the rental) like Car2Go and ZipCar have quickly expanded, with the number of US users doubling every 1-2. years over the past decade. Such programs seek to shift personal transportation choices from an owned asset to a service used on demand. The advent of autonomous or fully self-driving vehicles will address many current carsharing barriers, including users' travel to access available vehicles.This work describes the design of an agent-based model for shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) operations, the results of many case-study applications using this model, and the estimated environmental benefits of such settings, versus conventional vehicle ownership and use. The model operates by generating trips throughout a grid-based urban area, with each trip assigned an origin, destination and departure time, to mimic realistic travel profiles. A preliminary model run estimates the SAV fleet size required to reasonably service all trips, also using a variety of vehicle relocation strategies that seek to minimize future traveler wait times. Next, the model is run over one-hundred days, with driverless vehicles ferrying travelers from one destination to the next. During each 5-min interval, some unused SAVs relocate, attempting to shorten wait times for next-period travelers.Case studies vary trip generation rates, trip distribution patterns, network congestion levels, service area size, vehicle relocation strategies, and fleet size. Preliminary results indicate that each SAV can replace around eleven conventional vehicles, but adds up to 10% more travel distance than comparable non-SAV trips, resulting in overall beneficial emissions impacts, once fleet-efficiency changes and embodied versus in-use emissions are assessed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Results indicate that low vehicle ownership has the strongest, most consistent correlation to the amount of carsharing service in a neighborhood. Thresholds based on analysis results are outlined for low service (i.e., carsharing may be viable but limited growth can be expected) and high service (i.e., carsharing is likely to flourish). This tool to identify neighborhoods that can support carsharing is applied to a community seeking to establish a carsharing program: Austin, Texas. The analysis finds that several Austin neighborhoods have the characteristics to support carsharing (e.g., low vehicle ownership rates and high percentages of one-person households), but few Austin neighborhoods could support a high level of carsharing service.},

   abstract = {The recent strong growth of carsharing (CS) has taken place worldwide mainly in the large cities. We discuss whether there is a potential role for CS in medium to small-sized towns and in less-densely populated rural areas. In large cities CS is provided by large profit oriented firms, capable of offering efficient and flexible services, using the most advanced technologies with highly differentiated and customized prices. In lower density areas and small-to-medium size cities the challenges are much greater. The lower demand resulting from a complex of unfavorable factors (higher car ownership level, larger parking availability, low public transport service, fewer or absent taxi service and so on) requires a different business model for the provision of CS: more socially oriented, with a greater involvement of local municipalities and public transport operators to offer a service, most likely at favorable prices. The paper reports the results drawn from a survey on the potential demand for CS conducted in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region, Italy, a region characterized by small-sized towns and less-densely populated rural areas where CS is not currently offered. It is found that there is a not negligible demand (3.7% of the population holding a driving license) and that the likely users would be the ones that are better informed about CS, environmentally conscious and young. They would be more frequent among students or unemployed people, rather than among professionals, as in the more urban environments. It is also found that CS would mostly be used for non-commuting and longer trips.},

   abstract = {Smartphone technology enables dynamic ride-sharing systems that bring together people with similar itineraries and time schedules to share rides on short-notice. This paper considers the problem of matching drivers and riders in this dynamic setting. We develop optimization-based approaches that aim at minimizing the total system-wide vehicle miles incurred by system users, and their individual travel costs. To assess the merits of our methods we present a simulation study based on 2008 travel demand data from metropolitan Atlanta. The simulation results indicate that the use of sophisticated optimization methods instead of simple greedy matching rules substantially improve the performance of ride-sharing systems. Furthermore, even with relatively low participation rates, it appears that sustainable populations of dynamic ride-sharing participants may be possible even in relatively sprawling urban areas with many employment centers. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Can dynamic ride-sharing reduce traffic congestion? In this paper we show that the answer is yes if the trip density is high, which is usually the case in large-scale networks but not in medium-scale networks where opportunities for sharing in time and space become rather limited. When the demand density is high, the dynamic ride-sharing system can significantly improve traffic conditions, especially during peak hours. Sharing can compensate extra travel distances related to operating a mobility service. The situation is entirely different in small and medium-scale cities when trip shareability is small, even if the ride-sharing system is fully optimized based on the perfect demand prediction in the near future. The reason is simple, mobility services significantly increase the total travel distance, and sharing is simply a means of combating this trend without eliminating it when the trip density is not high enough. This paper proposes a complete framework to represent the functioning of the ride-sharing system and multiple steps to tackle the curse of dimensionality when solving the problem. We address the problem for two city scales in order to compare different trip densities. A city scale of 25 km2 with a total market of 11,235 shareable trips for the medium-scale network and a city scale of 80 km2 with 205,308 demand for service vehicles for the large-scale network over a 4-hour period with a rolling horizon of 20 minutes. The solutions are assessed using a dynamic trip-based macroscopic simulation to account for the congestion effect and dynamic travel times that may influence the optimal solution obtained with predicted travel times. This outperforms most previous studies on optimal fleet management that usually consider constant and fully deterministic travel time functions.},
