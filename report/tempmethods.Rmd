A BEAM scenario requires the following inputs:

- A transportation network
- An ODT fleet (or fleets) with fleet size and operating hours
- Transit information and schedules in the form of GTFS data
- Mode choice parameters
- Initial population daily plans




In order to create the initial input plans, we utilized the software packages PopulationSim <><><> and ActivitySim <><><><>. PopulationSim uses census data to create a synthetic population with individual home locations, where the total number of individuals matches the population of the study area. This synthetic population is designed to be representative of the area on metrics such as population density and income distribution, but avoids the privacy concerns of using data from actual individuals. This population can then be used as an input to ActivitySim. ActivitySim is an activity-based travel demand model in which individuals are assigned a set of daily plans based on area socioeconomic data and travel times/costs. The socioeconomic data is listed by Transportation Analysis Zone (TAZ) and includes information on job availability, number of workers, income, and other metrics. The travel times and costs are provided via network skims, detailing this information for trips between any given TAZs. ActivitySim uses this information, along with destination choice and mode choice equations, to assign trips to individuals coherently and with consistent mode choice (for example, an individual won't leave a personal vehicle at work and take transit home).

Most of the work in creating/obtaining the data for PopulationSim and Activitysim was done previously by @MacfarlaneLant, and we are using this data in our study. They adapted the ACS five-year census tract aggregation tables to create the input census data for PopulationSim and created a synthetic population modeling the Wasatch Front area in Utah. The network skims were obtained from the existing WFRC trip-based model, though some remapping was necessary. @MacfarlaneLant also created the TAZ socioeconomic data by combining various information from WFRC. However, while WFRC had much of the socioeconomic data needed, there was some information such as age distribution that needed to be obtained directly from the synthetic population previously created.

In addition to the population, skims, and socioeconomic data, ActivitySim relies on mode choice parameters to assign plans and transportation modes. Ideally, the mode choice output of ActivitySim would align with the existing WFRC model's mode distribution, and so @MacfarlaneLant ran a calibration exercise, adjusting the alternative-specific constants (ASCs) in ActivitySim until the mode share roughly matched that of the WFRC model. They note a couple discrepancies caused by inconsistencies in the available modes between the two models, but that the overall values were within 1.5% of the WFRC model and so considered their results to be within an acceptable margin of error.

However, one mode that was missing from this calibration exercise was ridehail. As we are modeling ODT as a pooled ridehail mode, we further calibrated ActivitySim including ridehail targets. The WFRC model predicts a ridehail mode share of 0.2%, and our initial ActivitySim outputs predicted a value much higher than this. We adjusted the ASCs for ridehail modes in ActivitySim, though ultimately the ridehail mode share converged around 1%, with further ASC adjustments having little to no effect. One potential reason for this is that no matter how low the utility of ridehail is, it occasionally may be the only mode available. For example, ActivitySim may assign a trip to an individual with no personal vehicle access, and if the trip is too far to walk, ridehail is the only mode that can be taken. Though this potentially could be resolved by adjusting the destination choice model, this was outside the scope of our research, and so we accepted this discrepancy but note it as a limitation of the study.
