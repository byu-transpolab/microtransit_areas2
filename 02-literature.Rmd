# Literature

Here is a review of existing methods. Use the `bookdown` [@xie2015] package
referencing system to make it easy on yourself.

The literature review is not simply a "review" or a list of what has been 
done in the past. This needs to a thoughtful synthesis that accomplishes two
things:

  - Shows that you understand the previous efforts that other people have
    made on this problem.
  - Identifies the limitation or the gap in those previous efforts. 
  
You will have already mentioned this gap in the introduction, but here you need
to build a solid case for why what you are doing is a meaningful contribution.
    
Literature reviews do not have a specific guidelines for length or number of
citations. It's more about making a rhetorical argument; if it's a new problem
then the review can be shorter. But you'll need to refer to previous attempts at
the problem, the methods you are trying, and other things.
